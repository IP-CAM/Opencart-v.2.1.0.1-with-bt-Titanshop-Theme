# Description
This freelance project, conducted on the Mostaqel platform, involved creating an online store for selling car parts, inspired by other successful web stores. The customer required a CMS-based solution, so I purchased the OpenCart TitnaShop CMS for them. I configured the CMS and customized the CSS design to match existing sites on the internet. Additionally, I integrated necessary modules to enhance the store's functionality.
